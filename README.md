# entertainment_system
A videogame framework to share with a friend to demonstrate some basic principles

---
This project consists of two parts, a "system" API providing basic input and output, and a demo game using that API. Start by taking a look at the bare-bones index.html file, and then read the documentation at the top of demo.js

The demo itself can be run locally without the need for an http server. Just open the index.html file in a browser.
